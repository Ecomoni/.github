High-tech research tools for ecologists
</h1>

## Our vision
Protecting and restoring biodiversity is critical to all life on Earth. Monitoring is an important tool to be able to preserve biodiversity. Ecologists play an important role in monitoring and preserving biodiversity. However, studying and reporting takes an enormous amount of time and capacity. Advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence, helps to save a lot of time by automatic processes and reducing noisy data.
‚Äç
Ecomoni returns time and capacity to the ecologists, so that they can devote themselves to their important substantive task. We innovate biodiversity sensors and monitoring technologies as an extension of the ecologist. To set up investigations in a smarter way and to make them run more smoothly.
